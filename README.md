# evil rating bot #

A bot created for the Discord chat platform that makes you decide which of two randomly selected images I find funnier.  
Made entirely in Python and uses the Discord.py library to interact with the app's API. 

Images are entirely hosted on the bot owner's filesystem, as well as the ratings themselves, which are held in the `ratings.json` file.

I had not programmed anything in Python before this, so this was pretty fun to do as a first project. If I came back to this in the future, then I would have the image files housed in a separate cloud hosted database, as well as another one that allowed anyone to submit any image that they wanted.
